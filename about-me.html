      <h2>My Story</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Adrian, I’m a 20-year-old creative from Slovakia currently living in the Netherlands, where I’m studying Creative Business at Breda University of Applied Sciences. I’ve always been passionate about visual storytelling, and photography became the perfect way for me to express that, especially when it comes to cars and travel.
      </p>
      <p>
        During my final year of high school, I made one of the biggest decisions of my life, I left home at 18 to start from scratch in a new country. Moving alone to the Netherlands wasn’t easy, but it helped me grow massively as a person. I’ve become almost fully independent, balancing my studies, a part-time job, creative projects, traveling, and time with friends. It’s a lifestyle I love, always evolving, always on the move.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m deeply passionate about photography, especially when it involves discovering new places or capturing the beauty of cars. Porsche, in particular, has always held a special place in my heart. I actually own around 40 miniature Porsche models, and one of my biggest dreams is to own a real one, one day. So far, I’ve explored 22 countries, and every trip gives me a fresh perspective that shapes the way I see the world.

        I’m currently working as an event photographer for ESN Breda, where I capture energy-filled moments at international student events. In the past, I’ve also worked on numerous school projects ranging from documentaries and short films to TV show concepts. Whether I was operating a three-camera setup, directing actors, or color grading final footage, I always tried to bring my best, even when things got tough, like finding actors last minute, shooting in unpredictable weather, or completely changing major parts mid shooting.

        One of my proudest technical achievements was designing and fully coding an e-commerce website from scratch for my high school graduation project. It gave me a strong base in front-end and back-end development, UX/UI design, and how to create seamless digital experiences, skills I’ve started applying to my personal brand and portfolio as well.
